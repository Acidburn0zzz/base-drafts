The frame has a SLOT ID similar to a FRAME ID but the SLOT ID can be reused indefinitely and the frame is not retransmitted. Ordering among slot frames is given by the packet number and the offset withint the packet, but it is not possible to tell how many slot frames were transmitted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to have a second SLOT type that has retransmission. Optionally there could also be a sequence counter for the retransmittable slot."

    "body": "@ekr asked which code a server might use to cancel streams that exceed a revised limit after 0-RTT in #479.\r\n\r\nMy initial response was CANCELLED, which I'm adding in #467.  However on reflection I think that might be a category error.  The application protocol should be the one to cancel things and we should use the HTTP-defined HTTP_REQUEST_CANCELLED instead.\r\n\r\nThe reason being twofold:\r\n\r\n* On general principles, the transport shouldn't be cancelling streams without first consulting the application layer; what if the transport cancelled stream 3 (or maybe stream 1)?  To the transport that's not special\r\n\r\n* Signaling the ability to retry is easier at the application layer.  At the transport layer the only way to distinguish between retryable and not is to ask whether any bytes were passed to the application layer.  At the application layer, even if bytes were delivered, the application might still be able to cancel without side effects."

    "body": "I did two things today in fairly quick succession, write up #480 and review a ghash implementation.  One of the biggest challenges with the ghash implementation is in dealing with architectures that don't have native 128 integers.\r\n\r\nFNV-1a requires multiplication of 128-bit integers.  Without native support for that operation, it's a lot more code to write and more corner cases to test.  \r\n\r\nGiven what we are using FNV-1a for, the 64-bit variant would be perfectly adequate and also considerably easier to implement.  I doubt that most of our implementer audience would know what Karatsuba multiplication is, nor should we force them to get acquainted with it."

Worse, if they are aware of extensions, they might reduce the size and then encounter a server that enforces the limit.  That server will discard the packet.  That makes enforcement risky.\r\n\r\nThis change places the limit on the payload.  It mandates 1232/1252 for v6/v4.\r\n\r\nThis is the uncomplicated version.  The complicated version that I didn't write up allows a client that knows more about overheads to reduce the payload size as long as they keep above some floor value (e.g., 1180).  We might consider doing that later if we want to allow QUIC to operate on paths with a much tighter MTU overhead.  Evidence suggests that we don't need this though (open an issue if you disagree).\r\n\r\nCloses #267"

    "body": "A client may operate on equal footing with a server, i.e. it is not always a HTTP browser client, but currently a client cannot send a PUBLIC_RESET:\r\n\r\n> A Public Reset packet is only sent by servers and is used to abruptly terminate communications. Public Reset is provided as an option of last resort for a server that does not have access to the state of a connection.\r\n\r\nThe problem is also that the purpose of PUBLIC_RESET is vague. The problem here is primarily that an endpoint might loose state during a crash and cannot tell peer to terminate the connection. The related use case for informing middle boxes is a separate topic.\r\n\r\nUse case: Datacenters might have private networking, but not across datacenters. QUIC could be used to form a peer-to-peer server network. There might be edge routers in each datacenter (e.g. into a Kubernetes network), or not, but either way end-points may have high volume bidirectional traffic that needs to stop. The situation can also happen within datacenters with private networks with co-location where QUIC protects against other customers on the network.\r\n\r\nEdge routers may have to also tear down the connection across datacenters (border gateway routing) which is then the separate middlebox issue.\r\n\r\nLost-state teardown need not involve any public activity and could avoid an obvious attack vector by using a non-public reset mechanism, but middlebox signalling need this. For the endpoint tear down, it could be replacing PUBLIC_RESET with a hint on lost connection which triggers surviving endpoint to perform a low volume liveness check, e.g. PING/ack at most every x ms.\r\n\r\nFurther consideration is that post-crash a server might have to load state from persistent storage in order to perform a reset proof that is not predictable. If this can be avoided via hint/live-ness verification, persistent state reset might be avoidable.\r\n\r\nalso discussed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/462#issuecomment-297383356"

There are a few little wrinkles that I think we might want to discuss a little.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is a one-time password. That means that the combination of key and connection ID can't ever be repeated for a given server instance.  Our 64-bit connection ID space isn't really enough to provide this.  How a server moves to a new static key during operation will be challenging; it probably needs to partition the connection ID space.\r\n\r\nSecond, transport parameters are encrypted.  #20 made a point of having the verifier in the clear so that intermediaries could validate the Public Reset.  I don't want to create a second TLS extension, but I guess that is the best option we have available to us if this is what is required.  I don't think we should move transport parameters into the clear either.\r\n\r\nCloses #215, #20."

Or, it can be useful hollistically: by aggregating reports over a large set you can determine whether a change to flow control tuning was successful.\r\n\r\nA sender of BLOCKED is currently obligated to retransmit lost BLOCKED frames.  That achieves the latter goal reasonably well, but it does little for the former because the state of the connection when BLOCKED was generated is unlikely to be the same when it is eventually retransmitted.  Even on the first transmission, the receiver of a BLOCKED frame still has to do quite a lot to work out what the state of the sender might have been.\r\n\r\nBLOCKED would be more useful if it reported the limit that caused it to be generated.

Client (or server) opens a large number of streams by sending stream data frames with new stream number and minimal content.\r\n\r\n2. Stream choke attack. Client sends request on a stream, then use stream level flow control to choke the transmission by the server. Apply to many parallel streams for bonus effect.\r\n\r\n3. Silly stream number attack. Client opens stream 2*N+1 for some outlandish version of N. Might play havoc with server management of incoming streams.\r\n\r\n4. Stream drop by drop attack. Client sends data on a stream extremely slowly, maybe 1 byte at a time. Server spin its wheels waiting for data.\r\n\r\nI don't think that these are controversial.  Most are already well-known, we just need text for them."

    "body": "According to life of a stream, a stream can transition from \"half closed local\" to \"closed\" by sending a \"RST\" or by receiving \"FIN\" or \"RST\" from peer. However, sending a \"RST\" may race ahead of any in-flight packets send to the peer. In fact this is likely because the stream will transmit according to a fair schedule while RST will likely be prioritised. The RST will tear down state on both ends preventing the peer from receiving and the local endpont from retransmitting (depending on implementation).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there is also a user aspect. QUIC does not define an API, but what does it mean to close a stream? Do you close the write stream or do you close both read and write stream? This can encoded as either sending \"FIN\" or \"FIN+RST\" but has the race condition mentioned. When cleaning up after a stream initiated locally, it appears you need to always eventually send a RST even if the peer has no interest in writing. Application protocol could agree to not require a RST, but that seems a bit roundabout.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is saner to handle read and write streams entirely separately.\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/175\r\n\r\nThe issue may also be related to:\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/61"

Suppose now that an application sends the STREAM-DATA opening stream 5 in one packet number X, and then the opening of stream 7 in the next packet, number X+1. This is a fairly natural thing to do, for example, for QUIC over DNS, where each transaction opens its own stream. \r\n\r\nSuppose now that packet number X is lost. Packet X+1 will be processed. The receiver will see for the first time a reference to stream 7, without having seen stream 5. In a strict reading of the spec, since streams MUST be created in sequential order, the receiver should signal an error, since streams have been created out of order. But that's fiendish. Or maybe it should queue the stream 7 packet until stream 5 has been open, but that would cause head of queue blocking. Or maybe it should not care about the MUST, and just open stream 7.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, if the receiver is willing to accept stream ID opened out of order, we can have different problems. How much out of order is too much? You may want to say \"1\", but consider that a client could easily pack a dozen DNS requests and as many stream opening in a single packet. If that packet is lost, there is a gap of a dozen stream ID.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the right solution should be. "

    "body": "In anticipation of partially reliable streams I considered how it might be done today with minimal impact.\r\n\r\nThe application can ask the QUIC API to only transmit or retransmit within a specific range limit or within a specific timeframe. If this is not to violate the current protocol, the QUIC engine must still transmit data but it can then choose to send just zeroes in order to free up internal or application controlled buffers. This is a waste of good bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe QUIC engine could support a stream frame with just zeroes, using a dedicated frame type, or just a flag in a the stream header if possible. When this is set, the frame data will be absent. At the receiving end, the engine can either just fill in zeroes, or inform the application of a zero block at a given range.\r\n\r\nWith a compressed zero frame, it is then possible to handle partially unreliable streams at the API level without involving the core protocol which need not care.\r\n\r\nA zero frame can also be useful if transmitting a memory mapped file that contains large amount of zeroes - although of course one would normally apply compression.\r\n\r\nA downside of zero frames is that the receiving end cannot tell if the zero block was lost data or just valid zero data. It may derive that from the application context, or perhaps there should be a distrinction between compresed zeroes and actual gap frames.\r\n\r\nAn upside is that the QUIC protocol need not deal with length markers within streams to identify what is a message boundary so only complete messages are dropped or retransmitted.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to sparse files and TRIM sectors in SSD devices.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many other, and possibly better, ways to deal with partially reliable streams, so this is just one idea I wanted to share.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: another downside is that the receiving end may be blocking for older data just to retrieve a zero frame. However, this can also be handled at the API level, allowing the receiver to advance the stream even if data is missing - zero frames are not needed for this, except the retransmission overhead. So zero frames still provide a consistent way to treat absent data without very close end-point coordination, which may also be useful when forwarding streams to new connections or when writing to a file.\r\n"

The vendor concern is that adding support for special handling of UDP packets on port 443 would have to be absolutely guaranteed to be QUIC. At least that's what I've been told.\r\n\r\nThe other option would be to add an identifier to every QUIC packet, such that they can uniquely identify it as such.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "[I am raising this for @csperkins; text below is from him.]\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the first octet of the new QUIC header is either:\r\n```\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |1|   Type (7)  |  Long header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |0|C|K| Type (5)|  Short header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\nGiven the assigned types, this gives number values for the first octet in the ranges 0-3, 32-35, 64-67, 96-99, or 128-136.\r\n\r\nRFC 7983 talks about how to demultiplex protocols running on a single UDP port, based on the values of the first octet. The important part is the new text table in Section 7, which demultiplexes based on the value of the first octet of the packet as follows:\r\n```\r\n                   +----------------+\r\n                   |        [0..3] -+--> forward to STUN\r\n                   |                |\r\n                   |      [16..19] -+--> forward to ZRTP\r\n                   |                |\r\n       packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS\r\n                   |                |\r\n                   |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel\r\n                   |                |\r\n                   |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP\r\n                   +----------------+\r\n```\r\nThe QUIC headers don’t fit cleanly into this. The result is that it’s not possible to run demultiplex QUIC and WebRTC running on the same UDP port, since WebRTC uses STUN, DTLS, TURN and RTP/RTCP. Demultiplexing these is probably desirable, since it would let you switch from web traffic to interactive WebRTC or very low latency streaming without de-doing the NAT bindings on a port.\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix to allow the protocols to be demultiplexed is to set the top two bits of the first octet of a QUIC packet to 1 and reduce the size of the type fields:\r\n```\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |1|1|1|Type (5) |  Long header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |1|1|0|C|K|Type3|  Short header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\nThere are probably other options that keep a larger type field, if we accept a less obvious bit packing, although even these likely lose one bit from the type field.\r\n"

    "body": "We've already had a lot of discussions about the concurrent streams limit, which all brought us back to the problem that at every given moment both peers have to agree about the number of open streams, which seems to require a non-trivial amount of bookkeeping (of ACKs received for all STREAM frames sent on a given stream).\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a different solution, which solves this problem, and has a couple of nice additional properties as well:\r\n\r\nA receiver advertises the maximum Stream ID it is willing to accept. The sender is allowed to open all streams that have IDs not larger than this number. The receiver can advertise a higher maximum Stream ID whenever it likes to, by sending a STREAM_LIMIT_UPDATE frame. STREAM_LIMIT_UPDATE is a retransmittable frame that contains a single value, the maximum Stream ID.\r\nNote that conceptually, this is similar to advertising a flow control offset (and the rules for STREAM_LIMIT_UPDATEs would be similar to those for WINDOW_UPDATEs).\r\n\r\nAn implementation is free to choose any algorithm to determine which maximum Stream ID it advertises. The number of open streams may be used, but I can think of a couple of other ways to limit the state a peer can create. It would even be possible to advertise different limits depending on the server load."

    "body": "There is a common problem throughout the draft whereby the document talks about state transitions triggered by sending a packet.  This is necessary when the state causes resources to be committed, but when resources are freed it is invariably wrong.\r\n\r\nThus, we have two classes situations for a sender that need to be clearly distinguished:\r\n\r\n1. Actions that reserve resources take effect as soon as the first packet is sent.  This includes:\r\n   * sending the first STREAM frame on a stream (which consumes a concurrent stream),\r\n   * the first transmission of and STREAM data (which moves the flow control offset),\r\n   * sending a packet that adds to the header table (which reduces the available space there), \r\n   * etc...\r\n\r\n2. Actions that release resources take effect when they are acknowledged.  This includes:\r\n   * sending a STREAM frame with the FIN flag set (which can release a stream),\r\n   * sending a RST_STREAM frame (which can release a stream),\r\n   * deleting a header table entry (which eventually frees space),\r\n   * etc...\r\n\r\nWhen describing these, we need to be careful to be very precise about these things.  In particular, STREAM frames with a FIN flag can both consume resource and release them.  The consumption happens immediately, but the release depends on acknowledgment."

    "body": "TLS has an extension on the NewSessionTicket that limits the amount of early data.  This limits the number of plaintext octets (not including padding) that can be send in early data.  This allows a server to constrain how much clients send in 0-RTT.\r\n\r\nWe could reuse and repurpose that extension for QUIC, but we would have to do so explicitly.  Currently, we do not.  Or, we could define a new transport parameter that explicitly limits the size of incoming 0-RTT data.\r\n\r\nWe could define this count in a number of ways:\r\n1. Count the number of octets in each packet before packet protection is applied.\r\n2. As 1, except after packet protection is applied.\r\n3. Count everything except padding.\r\n4. Count only STREAM payloads (i.e., use the same accounting as flow control).\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for option 4 for reasons what will become obvious in a parallel discussion (see #390)."

    "body": "We now forbid the generation of an ACK in response to an ACK (lest the two endpoints talk each other to death over nothing), rather than recommend acknowledging only a fraction of ACKs.  That's great, and much easier to implement.\r\n\r\nHowever, when removing STOP_WAITING, @ianswett wanted to have a way to solicit an ACK so that a receiver could stop sending acknowledgments for some packets.  He suggested using PING, which is great.  I have another suggestion that I think is superior: WINDOW_UPDATE.  Like PING, WINDOW_UPDATE causes an ACK to be generated, albeit with less urgency and a receiver is highly like to need to send one occasionally.  I think that PING is still viable, but WINDOW_UPDATE is likely to happen naturally anyway."

    "body": "This is related to #353.\r\n\r\nWhat would we expect endpoints to do upon the receipt of ICMP (or ICMPv6) Type=DestinationUnreachable?  For IPv6, that message has a large chunk of the original packet, proving that a path element sent it. For IPv4, there is very little entropy there (just your src port).\r\n\r\nCan this be as trusted as PUBLIC_RESET by Clients? For IPv4 the answer is likely to be \"no\". For ipv6, I am not that sure. But there are real implications for clients that cannot just fall back to tcp.\r\n\r\nIf you ignore ICMP and keep retrying the dead server, you are very likely missing an opportunity to switch the server (switch to another IP offered by DNS).\r\n\r\nIf you do not ignore ICMP (especially ICMPv4) and try reopening the connection (using a different server IP), you are allowing using your client in a highly amplified reflection DDOS attack against the sever. The attacker just needs to send you a slow stream of forged ICMP to get you to keep re-opening/re-negotiating connections and retrying expensive requests."

It really only updates the frames defined in RFC7540; the ALTSVC frame defined in RFC7838 isn't updated.\r\n\r\nIt would be a simple update, but the question is where it belongs.  Should we:\r\n\r\n- Add text in this document to include that frame, because it is \"existing\"?\r\n- Write a new (very short) document updating RFC7838 with HTTP/QUIC support, following the recommendations in #363?\r\n- Kick it back to the httpbis working group to write exactly the same very short document?\r\n\r\nNote that the latter two options probably differ by nothing but the filename of the I-D in question -- the same people will probably end up writing it."

However, if you receive STREAM frames out of order, you can know that more data is in flight, even if you haven't received it.  Currently, that data implicitly counts against the receiver's stream window (since it's a max offset), but not against the connection window.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the receiver of a DISINTEREST frame to silently stop retransmission if the STREAM w/ FIN had already been acknowledged (without generating a RST_STREAM) since the flow control states on both sides would be consistent.  However, it would also require more logic on STREAM receipt, since it's no longer just a running counter of the size of all received STREAM frames."

That would require that the error code be made public knowledge.\r\n\r\nI can see a few advantages for a middlebox, primary of these being a clear signal that a connection is done (though that would not be something that could be strongly authenticated).  It would also simplify state on servers that decide to terminate a connection: they only have to keep whatever information they need to generate a Public Reset, which is a single piece of global state. \r\n\r\nThe downside is the insights that the error code give into the otherwise confidential operations of the protocol (we'd likely want to tighten the level of detail in error codes).  Also, it means that a server that wants to permit retries would have to send two packets: a GOAWAY packet in addition to the Public Reset."

    "body": "My sense is that we'd like the server to chose the \"real\" connection ID to be used for a connection. Among other things, this enables servers to embed routing/load balancing information into connection IDs.\r\n\r\nI have heard two options for what the client should do before it has a server-chosen connection ID.\r\n\r\n1) Send a random connection ID\r\n2) Send a connection ID of 0\r\n\r\nIf we go with approach 1, then we need some mechanism that load balancers can use to detect if a packet's connection ID is server-chosen or not. It seems likely that all packets encrypted with 1-RTT keys could use server generated connection IDs. But other packets it's not so clear. Consider the case of a non-0-RTT handshake. The initial client handshake packet would include a client-chosen connection ID. When the server replies, it could use a server-chosen connection ID. If so then when the client sends the next handshake packet it could use the server-chosen connection ID as well. But that means that we'd need a mechanism to disambiguate client handshake packets with client-chosen connection IDs from client handshake packets with server-chosen connection IDs. We could devote bits or packet types to indicate this. I suspect the same argument might hold for server handshake packets. We might not want the server to chose a connection ID until it is ready to accept the handshake.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of this approach, however, is that a QUIC server could chose to simply use the client's connection ID for the duration of the connection. This would mean that it would not need to be able to generate a new connection ID that is guaranteed to be sent by the load balancer back to itself. In cases where the vendor of the load balancer and the server are not the same, this might be valuable.\r\n\r\nIf we go with approach 2, then it's obvious that any packet with a non-zero connection ID has a server-chosen connection ID (though the server still may want to verify that it's a \"valid\" connection ID according to the algorithm it uses). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this requires QUIC servers which are behind load balancers to be able to generate connection IDs which the load balancer will route back to them. If the server and load balancers are from different vendors, this might be challenging.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "A lost handshake packet is retransmitted after 400ms (assuming that you don't have prior knowledge of the RTT, if you do then it is 2xRTT).  I realize that this is probably shorter than in TCP, but it's still a damned long time to wait.\r\n\r\nWe are far more aggressive in this in WebRTC with DTLS.  For example, NSS retransmits three times before QUIC even sends its first: at 50ms, 150ms, and 350ms.  We haven't seen much evidence that this is bring the Internet to its knees.  It's certainly good for latency to retransmit more aggressively.  Separately, we also send ICE probes much faster, without the back-off, though those are typically much smaller.\r\n\r\nThat said, if retransmitting at this pace is somehow doing damage to something, it would be good to understand why this is the case.  We're definitely interested in avoiding an inadvertent damage that we're doing and changing the above numbers could happen pretty quickly with proper justification."
