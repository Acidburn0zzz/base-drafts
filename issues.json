I would argue that no self-interested client will do so if the connection is latency-sensitive, since you incur an RTT, unless the spec has this at a higher level than MAY and with specific timing.\r\n\r\nHowever, for HTTP, bringing up a connection to a new Alternative is not latency-sensitive (because you still have your connection to the original host).  In the case where you're bringing up a connection to an alternative instead of to the origin, you've likely talked to the alternative before.\r\n\r\nWe could consider dropping the Alt-Svc version hint entirely, and saying that clients SHOULD open with a reserved version unless it has previously connected to the server and remembers a version list."

That smells like something from the Google QUIC implementation.  We should be more concrete about this, if that behaviour even makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf an endpoint is receiving nothing but ACKs but is sending itself, then acknowledging those ACKs is probably fine.\r\n\r\nAn endpoint with nothing to say can generate a lot of ACKs over time, but if both endpoints are being quiet other than ACKs, it's probably time to shut up entirely.  Maybe we should say that the peer SHOULD generate an ACK frame only if it has other frame types to send.\r\n\r\nLimiting the number of PING frames that a peer will respond to is a separate issue, and may motivate a limit with a number attached to it.\r\n"

It seems like it might mean unacknowledged, not including packets that were marked as \"lost\" by the recovery algorithm.  The difference between the current packet number and the highest acknowledged packet number might also work.\r\n\r\nThe more that I think about this, the more that I'm convinced that this is made up of 90% fudge.  Neither of the above definitions for \"in flight\" is perfect and the constant (4) is pure fudge.\r\n\r\nWhat we might ideally want to ask before determining how big the packet number encoding needs to be is how far out of order a packet could possibly get during transit - and at what point we consider excessive reordering to be considered loss.  If we assume either definition, the current mandate assumes that we want to recover from delay of 4 times the RTT (with the first definition, add four times the reordering threshold).\r\n\r\nThat seems excessive.  Given that we should be getting at least an ACK per RTT in these cases, that much delay will likely result in retransmission several times over unless all of the ACK packets are similarly delayed.\r\n\r\nWhile we might make some recommendations, \"MUST\" doesn't seem correct.  I suspect that we need data on reordering (or packet delays) under real-world conditions before we could make a better recommendation.\r\n\r\nI think that we need to make the following changes: \r\n1. define \"in flight\" (or use a new definition based on RTT and the reordering threshold)\r\n2. make this a recommendation rather than a requirement\r\n3. update the values in the recommendation based on data\r\n4. maybe advise being conservative: spending an extra byte or two occasionally might be wise if it means avoiding packets being lost\r\n\r\nThis issue should wait for the outcome of the header discussions, it could become moot."

The receiver would have to know what of its acknowledgments had arrived at the sender in order to know what was outstanding when the sender generated the packet.

    "body": "In HTTP/2, streams states were modified at the point that a PUSH_PROMISE was sent, but actually using that stream could be deferred.  The \"reserved\" state didn't count toward concurrency limit, those streams would count only when packets were first sent.\r\n\r\nIf the client had a low concurrency limit, that could mean that use of promised streams had to be deferred until active streams could be closed.  QUIC maintains a similar model, but that model is incompatible with QUIC.  In HTTP/2, any promised streams can be opened without creating any ambiguity about the state of other reserved streams.  HTTP/2 also allowed endpoints to skip stream numbers.\r\n\r\nIn QUIC the lack of ordering between streams (a feature!) forces us to insist on having a strict monotonic sequence of stream numbers.  If a stream number appears to be skipped, that is only because a packet using it has not yet arrived.  This ensures much simpler accounting for streams and avoids adding latency to stream creation.\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem for promises.  Servers cannot use streams in any order, only those streams within the window of streams permitted by the client concurrency limit are free to be used.\r\n\r\nFor example, a client could have an MSPC of 2.  That allows just one server push at a time.  A server that wants to push two resources could advertise one push on streams 4+6 and the other on 8+10.  However, unlike in HTTP/2 the server cannot start the second push first.  Opening stream 8 would imply that streams 4 and 6 are also open, violating the concurrency limit.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear that this problem needs a solution, but it is a functional regression that we should at least consider and make a conscious decision to accept."

    "body": "This PR is based on the outcome of the discussion in #174.  The observation there is that using stream X implicitly opens stream X-2; since all streams are opened in sequence, it must just be that the packets that mention stream X-2 got delayed or lost somehow.\r\n\r\nOnce you accept that, it's also reasonable to allow a different order of stream creation (the point at which numbers are allocated) and stream *use* (when you send packets on a stream).  This neatly addresses the issue whereby server push can promise use of streams, but not use them in the order in which they were promised.\r\n\r\nThere's a catch here, and it's not one that was introduced by this change, if a server promises more streams than the client permits in its concurrent streams limit, the server cannot use streams beyond the limit.  I'll open a bug on that.\r\n\r\nCloses #182 - that removed only a few of the application actions.  This removes all of them.\r\nCloses #174."

    "body": "Something that came up in Tokyo was the need for service providers (i.e. middleboxes) to troubleshoot performance issues in the network. Packet Number Echo (#269) could partially address this problem., particularly for RTT measurement. But it is imperfect for measuring other problems.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has spent quite a bit of time debugging TCP packet traces from service providers, there are two other things that would help greatly in answering the question \"why is my QUIC slow\", without significantly compromising privacy. To do both would take two bits in the public flags, which may be available depending on how some other issues turn out.\r\n\r\n(1) QUIC endpoints MAY set the BLOCKED bit if they include a BLOCKED frame in the packet. If you want to get fancy, you could have a different bit for \"stream blocked\" and \"connection blocked\", but flow control issues are a common cause of traffic pauses with no other discernable symptoms.\r\n(2) QUIC endpoints MUST (SHOULD?) set the RETRANS flag in any packet that contains retransmitted data. This would help operators identify that a connection is slowing down because it is responding to loss, and would allow for very reliable loss statistics for the downstream network."

As agreed at the interim, TLS will host the source address validation packets, but the transport will be responsible for constructing and validating the token.  I've expanded the detailed interface section to cover this.\r\n\r\nThere's some finessing in the text around which part adds the integrity check, with the recognition that - because the token will likely be put alongside other TLS information that needs integrity checks - TLS is probably the best place to do that.\r\n\r\nThis builds on #122 because to do otherwise would be to invite merge conflict hell.  Once that is merged, this will be much easier to review.\r\n\r\nCloses #52."

    "body": "PR #106 added the following requirement on servers:\r\n\r\n> Servers MUST reject the first plaintext packet received from a client if it its total size is less than 1280 octets, to mitigate amplification attacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, this runs into an issue in the case where there are IP header extensions that the client knows about but the server doesn't.  If the client is aware of the IP header extensions and constructs a packet with a smaller payload in order to comply with our recommendation to create a packet of exactly 1280 octets, the server will receive a packet that it thinks is too small.\r\n\r\nI see a few options:\r\n1. loosen the enforcement constraint on the server\r\n2. specify that the server only enforce the constraint if it sees the entire IP packet\r\n3. specify the minimum size and its enforcement in terms of payload size (we could set different values here to allow for header extensions)"
