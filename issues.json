    "body": "TLS has an extension on the NewSessionTicket that limits the amount of early data.  This limits the number of plaintext octets (not including padding) that can be send in early data.  This allows a server to constrain how much clients send in 0-RTT.\r\n\r\nWe could reuse and repurpose that extension for QUIC, but we would have to do so explicitly.  Currently, we do not.  Or, we could define a new transport parameter that explicitly limits the size of incoming 0-RTT data.\r\n\r\nWe could define this count in a number of ways:\r\n1. Count the number of octets in each packet before packet protection is applied.\r\n2. As 1, except after packet protection is applied.\r\n3. Count everything except padding.\r\n4. Count only STREAM payloads (i.e., use the same accounting as flow control).\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for option 4 for reasons what will become obvious in a parallel discussion (see #390)."

    "body": "We now forbid the generation of an ACK in response to an ACK (lest the two endpoints talk each other to death over nothing), rather than recommend acknowledging only a fraction of ACKs.  That's great, and much easier to implement.\r\n\r\nHowever, when removing STOP_WAITING, @ianswett wanted to have a way to solicit an ACK so that a receiver could stop sending acknowledgments for some packets.  He suggested using PING, which is great.  I have another suggestion that I think is superior: WINDOW_UPDATE.  Like PING, WINDOW_UPDATE causes an ACK to be generated, albeit with less urgency and a receiver is highly like to need to send one occasionally.  I think that PING is still viable, but WINDOW_UPDATE is likely to happen naturally anyway."

    "body": "This is related to #353.\r\n\r\nWhat would we expect endpoints to do upon the receipt of ICMP (or ICMPv6) Type=DestinationUnreachable?  For IPv6, that message has a large chunk of the original packet, proving that a path element sent it. For IPv4, there is very little entropy there (just your src port).\r\n\r\nCan this be as trusted as PUBLIC_RESET by Clients? For IPv4 the answer is likely to be \"no\". For ipv6, I am not that sure. But there are real implications for clients that cannot just fall back to tcp.\r\n\r\nIf you ignore ICMP and keep retrying the dead server, you are very likely missing an opportunity to switch the server (switch to another IP offered by DNS).\r\n\r\nIf you do not ignore ICMP (especially ICMPv4) and try reopening the connection (using a different server IP), you are allowing using your client in a highly amplified reflection DDOS attack against the sever. The attacker just needs to send you a slow stream of forged ICMP to get you to keep re-opening/re-negotiating connections and retrying expensive requests."

It really only updates the frames defined in RFC7540; the ALTSVC frame defined in RFC7838 isn't updated.\r\n\r\nIt would be a simple update, but the question is where it belongs.  Should we:\r\n\r\n- Add text in this document to include that frame, because it is \"existing\"?\r\n- Write a new (very short) document updating RFC7838 with HTTP/QUIC support, following the recommendations in #363?\r\n- Kick it back to the httpbis working group to write exactly the same very short document?\r\n\r\nNote that the latter two options probably differ by nothing but the filename of the I-D in question -- the same people will probably end up writing it."

However, if you receive STREAM frames out of order, you can know that more data is in flight, even if you haven't received it.  Currently, that data implicitly counts against the receiver's stream window (since it's a max offset), but not against the connection window.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the receiver of a DISINTEREST frame to silently stop retransmission if the STREAM w/ FIN had already been acknowledged (without generating a RST_STREAM) since the flow control states on both sides would be consistent.  However, it would also require more logic on STREAM receipt, since it's no longer just a running counter of the size of all received STREAM frames."

That would require that the error code be made public knowledge.\r\n\r\nI can see a few advantages for a middlebox, primary of these being a clear signal that a connection is done (though that would not be something that could be strongly authenticated).  It would also simplify state on servers that decide to terminate a connection: they only have to keep whatever information they need to generate a Public Reset, which is a single piece of global state. \r\n\r\nThe downside is the insights that the error code give into the otherwise confidential operations of the protocol (we'd likely want to tighten the level of detail in error codes).  Also, it means that a server that wants to permit retries would have to send two packets: a GOAWAY packet in addition to the Public Reset."

    "body": "My sense is that we'd like the server to chose the \"real\" connection ID to be used for a connection. Among other things, this enables servers to embed routing/load balancing information into connection IDs.\r\n\r\nI have heard two options for what the client should do before it has a server-chosen connection ID.\r\n\r\n1) Send a random connection ID\r\n2) Send a connection ID of 0\r\n\r\nIf we go with approach 1, then we need some mechanism that load balancers can use to detect if a packet's connection ID is server-chosen or not. It seems likely that all packets encrypted with 1-RTT keys could use server generated connection IDs. But other packets it's not so clear. Consider the case of a non-0-RTT handshake. The initial client handshake packet would include a client-chosen connection ID. When the server replies, it could use a server-chosen connection ID. If so then when the client sends the next handshake packet it could use the server-chosen connection ID as well. But that means that we'd need a mechanism to disambiguate client handshake packets with client-chosen connection IDs from client handshake packets with server-chosen connection IDs. We could devote bits or packet types to indicate this. I suspect the same argument might hold for server handshake packets. We might not want the server to chose a connection ID until it is ready to accept the handshake.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of this approach, however, is that a QUIC server could chose to simply use the client's connection ID for the duration of the connection. This would mean that it would not need to be able to generate a new connection ID that is guaranteed to be sent by the load balancer back to itself. In cases where the vendor of the load balancer and the server are not the same, this might be valuable.\r\n\r\nIf we go with approach 2, then it's obvious that any packet with a non-zero connection ID has a server-chosen connection ID (though the server still may want to verify that it's a \"valid\" connection ID according to the algorithm it uses). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this requires QUIC servers which are behind load balancers to be able to generate connection IDs which the load balancer will route back to them. If the server and load balancers are from different vendors, this might be challenging.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "A lost handshake packet is retransmitted after 400ms (assuming that you don't have prior knowledge of the RTT, if you do then it is 2xRTT).  I realize that this is probably shorter than in TCP, but it's still a damned long time to wait.\r\n\r\nWe are far more aggressive in this in WebRTC with DTLS.  For example, NSS retransmits three times before QUIC even sends its first: at 50ms, 150ms, and 350ms.  We haven't seen much evidence that this is bring the Internet to its knees.  It's certainly good for latency to retransmit more aggressively.  Separately, we also send ICE probes much faster, without the back-off, though those are typically much smaller.\r\n\r\nThat said, if retransmitting at this pace is somehow doing damage to something, it would be good to understand why this is the case.  We're definitely interested in avoiding an inadvertent damage that we're doing and changing the above numbers could happen pretty quickly with proper justification."

    "body": "We're starting to see a few cases where ACK frames are being used to close the loop on things.  But that raises questions like \"if a peer acknowledges a packet containing a GOAWAY, does that mean I can assume that stream above the mentioned number are now closed at their end?\"\r\n\r\nI think that we need to state what the rule is, and it should be simple.  An acknowledgement for a packet implies that all QUIC-level control messages have been read and processed.\r\n\r\nThis includes PING, ACK, RST_STREAM, GOAWAY, etc...  I think that it also has to include FIN bits on STREAM frames.  That implies that the *transport* must have finished handling all the messages.\r\n\r\nThe application protocol might not have consumed the data from STREAM frames, but that is the only thing that is considered outstanding when a packet is acknowledged.  We have a special sort of acknowledgment for data: flow control credits.\r\n\r\nIf we add features that include special acknowledgement (like flow control), then those would be excluded, but that would be explicitly stated.  Otherwise, if it is in the transport and it is acknowledged, then it has been processed by the receiver."

We could avoid this by multiplying these values by a constant (she suggests 1024), which would reduce the granularity with which flow control credits could be granted, but increase the total lifetime of a long-lived connection.\r\n\r\nSo, trade-off time.  The scaling multiplier is now 1.  A larger value allows for longer-lived connections, a shorter value allows finer control over flow control.  I'd suggest that values in the order of 8 are probably easy to justify, can we go as high as 1024?\r\n\r\nWe could also choose a different value for the connection and stream flow control offsets on that basis that connections need more octets, whereas streams do not."

I would suggest that the analog of a TCP FIN is a FIN on a QUIC stream as they both gracefully half-close a single bidirectional communication channel. After a FIN, retransmission of data may still occur to deal with packet loss.\r\n\r\nA QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE, on the other hand, is an immediate termination of the connection. No more data is retransmitted. As such it is more like a TCP RST."

Setting a mandatory floor on the value might be reasonable, but I'd be reluctant to do that unless it was pretty low, or if the value were different for different packet number sizes (smaller margins are probably more justifiable for larger packet number encodings).\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should science this and try to measure probabilities of reordering.  Ideally reordering probability as a function of outstanding packets."

    "body": "The text for `DetectLostPackets` claims that `acked_packet` is a packet number, but the code shows it as having a `packet_number` field, as well as a `time_sent` field.  Maybe a TimeSent() lookup function would work, but at the level that this code operates, I think that it would be better to talk about packets in the abstract.  A real implementation might not carry around all the information a packet might accumulate, but that's for real implementations to worry about."

Both endpoints only need to maintain timing information for individual packets for a short period, so retransmission of old timing information isn't valuable.\r\n\r\nThus, we should recommend that endpoints do just that: maintain a short list of packets that they want to provide timing for.

    "body": "> skipping packet numbers between 1 and 255 effectively provides up to 8 bits of efficient entropy on  demand, which should be adequate protection against most opportunistic acknowledgement attacks.\r\n\r\nAside from the odd phrasing, I think that this is incorrect.  Aside from the obvious point that 1-255 is only  7.994 bits of entropy, you also have to take into account the probability that a sender chooses to skip (a probability of 2^-8 would give the answer here).  Add to that the fact that any entropy accumulates with every packet sent.  Choosing to send or withhold each packet number could add up to a bit of entropy over time, so the difficulty in guessing could be higher over time.\r\n\r\nNo matter what strategy it's always safe for an attacker to guess high, so the amount of effective entropy against an attacker is probably less than claimed.  Of course, guessing high has an effect on congestion control, because that is marked by the sender as loss.  That could be as effective in mitigating the optimistic acknowledgment attack as the gap itself.\r\n\r\nThen there is real packet loss.  If you randomly decide to skip 255 numbers, then real packet loss on the packet after the gap makes it difficult to acknowledge (you have to send two ACK frames if there is a gap >255).  Burst loss makes that even more likely.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'd recommend removing any claim about entropy.  I also recommend removing any mention of specific numbers.  Skipping more packets is fine, but it means that you run the packet number space down faster and you get less efficiency in ACK packets."

    "body": "Ostensibly, the `quic` parameter is a performance optimization for Alt-Svc.  A client can learn what QUIC version is most likely to succeed and use that version.  That increases the chances that version negotiation succeeds and thereby reduces the chance that the QUIC connection setup costs an extra round trip.\r\n\r\nHowever, alternative services is precisely the point where performance is not critical.  The client already has a perfectly functional HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 connection to the server.  This is a point where they could afford an additional round trip on connection setup.\r\n\r\n@MikeBishop suggested that if we are serious about greasing version negotiation, perhaps we could remove the `quic` parameter from the Alt-Svc header field and force clients to always pick a greased version number for their initial packet.\r\n\r\nAdvantages: grease more often and version negotiation actually gets a real workout, disadvantages: an extra round trip every time you use Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\nThis came up in #278."

I would argue that no self-interested client will do so if the connection is latency-sensitive, since you incur an RTT, unless the spec has this at a higher level than MAY and with specific timing.\r\n\r\nHowever, for HTTP, bringing up a connection to a new Alternative is not latency-sensitive (because you still have your connection to the original host).  In the case where you're bringing up a connection to an alternative instead of to the origin, you've likely talked to the alternative before.\r\n\r\nWe could consider dropping the Alt-Svc version hint entirely, and saying that clients SHOULD open with a reserved version unless it has previously connected to the server and remembers a version list."

    "body": "The text says:\r\n\r\n> However, since it is possible that an endpoint might only send packets containing ACK frames (or other non-retransmittable frames), the receiving peer MAY send an ACK frame after a reasonable number (currently 20) of such packets have been received.\r\n\r\n\"currently 20\" seems pretty arbitrary.  That smells like something from the Google QUIC implementation.  We should be more concrete about this, if that behaviour even makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf an endpoint is receiving nothing but ACKs but is sending itself, then acknowledging those ACKs is probably fine.\r\n\r\nAn endpoint with nothing to say can generate a lot of ACKs over time, but if both endpoints are being quiet other than ACKs, it's probably time to shut up entirely.  Maybe we should say that the peer SHOULD generate an ACK frame only if it has other frame types to send.\r\n\r\nLimiting the number of PING frames that a peer will respond to is a separate issue, and may motivate a limit with a number attached to it.\r\n"

    "body": "The text for packet number size calculation says:\r\n\r\n> a QUIC sender MUST NOT have more than 2^(packet_number_size - 2) in flight\r\n\r\nWhat it means to be \"in flight\" is not defined.  It seems like it might mean unacknowledged, not including packets that were marked as \"lost\" by the recovery algorithm.  The difference between the current packet number and the highest acknowledged packet number might also work.\r\n\r\nThe more that I think about this, the more that I'm convinced that this is made up of 90% fudge.  Neither of the above definitions for \"in flight\" is perfect and the constant (4) is pure fudge.\r\n\r\nWhat we might ideally want to ask before determining how big the packet number encoding needs to be is how far out of order a packet could possibly get during transit - and at what point we consider excessive reordering to be considered loss.  If we assume either definition, the current mandate assumes that we want to recover from delay of 4 times the RTT (with the first definition, add four times the reordering threshold).\r\n\r\nThat seems excessive.  Given that we should be getting at least an ACK per RTT in these cases, that much delay will likely result in retransmission several times over unless all of the ACK packets are similarly delayed.\r\n\r\nWhile we might make some recommendations, \"MUST\" doesn't seem correct.  I suspect that we need data on reordering (or packet delays) under real-world conditions before we could make a better recommendation.\r\n\r\nI think that we need to make the following changes: \r\n1. define \"in flight\" (or use a new definition based on RTT and the reordering threshold)\r\n2. make this a recommendation rather than a requirement\r\n3. update the values in the recommendation based on data\r\n4. maybe advise being conservative: spending an extra byte or two occasionally might be wise if it means avoiding packets being lost\r\n\r\nThis issue should wait for the outcome of the header discussions, it could become moot."

Specifically, should the receiver drop packets that are received outside this window?\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, we require that the packet number size be determined based on the number of outstanding (undefined, but assumed to be packets that are sent but not yet acknowledged).\r\n\r\nA requirement like this would be virtually impossible to enforce.  The receiver would have to know what of its acknowledgments had arrived at the sender in order to know what was outstanding when the sender generated the packet.

    "body": "In HTTP/2, streams states were modified at the point that a PUSH_PROMISE was sent, but actually using that stream could be deferred.  The \"reserved\" state didn't count toward concurrency limit, those streams would count only when packets were first sent.\r\n\r\nIf the client had a low concurrency limit, that could mean that use of promised streams had to be deferred until active streams could be closed.  QUIC maintains a similar model, but that model is incompatible with QUIC.  In HTTP/2, any promised streams can be opened without creating any ambiguity about the state of other reserved streams.  HTTP/2 also allowed endpoints to skip stream numbers.\r\n\r\nIn QUIC the lack of ordering between streams (a feature!) forces us to insist on having a strict monotonic sequence of stream numbers.  If a stream number appears to be skipped, that is only because a packet using it has not yet arrived.  This ensures much simpler accounting for streams and avoids adding latency to stream creation.\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem for promises.  Servers cannot use streams in any order, only those streams within the window of streams permitted by the client concurrency limit are free to be used.\r\n\r\nFor example, a client could have an MSPC of 2.  That allows just one server push at a time.  A server that wants to push two resources could advertise one push on streams 4+6 and the other on 8+10.  However, unlike in HTTP/2 the server cannot start the second push first.  Opening stream 8 would imply that streams 4 and 6 are also open, violating the concurrency limit.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear that this problem needs a solution, but it is a functional regression that we should at least consider and make a conscious decision to accept."

The observation there is that using stream X implicitly opens stream X-2; since all streams are opened in sequence, it must just be that the packets that mention stream X-2 got delayed or lost somehow.\r\n\r\nOnce you accept that, it's also reasonable to allow a different order of stream creation (the point at which numbers are allocated) and stream *use* (when you send packets on a stream).  This neatly addresses the issue whereby server push can promise use of streams, but not use them in the order in which they were promised.\r\n\r\nThere's a catch here, and it's not one that was introduced by this change, if a server promises more streams than the client permits in its concurrent streams limit, the server cannot use streams beyond the limit.  I'll open a bug on that.\r\n\r\nCloses #182 - that removed only a few of the application actions.  This removes all of them.\r\nCloses #174."

    "body": "Something that came up in Tokyo was the need for service providers (i.e. middleboxes) to troubleshoot performance issues in the network. Packet Number Echo (#269) could partially address this problem., particularly for RTT measurement. But it is imperfect for measuring other problems.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has spent quite a bit of time debugging TCP packet traces from service providers, there are two other things that would help greatly in answering the question \"why is my QUIC slow\", without significantly compromising privacy. To do both would take two bits in the public flags, which may be available depending on how some other issues turn out.\r\n\r\n(1) QUIC endpoints MAY set the BLOCKED bit if they include a BLOCKED frame in the packet. If you want to get fancy, you could have a different bit for \"stream blocked\" and \"connection blocked\", but flow control issues are a common cause of traffic pauses with no other discernable symptoms.\r\n(2) QUIC endpoints MUST (SHOULD?) set the RETRANS flag in any packet that contains retransmitted data. This would help operators identify that a connection is slowing down because it is responding to loss, and would allow for very reliable loss statistics for the downstream network."

    "body": "This is an issue we briefly discussed in a coffee break in Tokyo, that nobody has written up so far.\r\n\r\nWe currently don't have a definition of the number of concurrent streams that both peers agree on at every given moment. Chrome and quic-go solve this problem by allowing a higher number of open streams (10% or 10 streams more, whichever is higher, than the advertised limit). This seems to work fine for HTTP, but will probably break down when using many short-lived streams.\r\n\r\n### Problem analysis\r\n\r\nThe main problem here is that it is very difficult for the sender to determine if the receiver considers a stream closed at any given moment. To do so, it would have to keep track of all packets containing stream data for that stream. Only when all of those packets have been ACKed (or retransmissions of those packets, if any packets were lost), it knows that the stream changed its state on the receiver's side.\r\n\r\nI think there's a more fundamental problem hidden here: Receiving a FIN should not cause a state transition in the first place. The concurrent stream limit is supposed to protect a receiver from allocating to many resources. Therefore, a stream should only be considered closed once the application finished reading from that stream (which, if it is reading the whole stream data, is only possible after receiving the FIN, but might be an arbitrary amount of time later, if the application is reading slowly).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a way for the receiver to tell the sender that it considers a stream closed. We could introduce a CLOSED_STREAM frame type for that.\r\nA peer would send a CLOSED_STREAM frame only after it closed the stream locally (i.e. only from the *half closed (locally)* state) and after it finished reading from the stream. \r\nA peer receiving a CLOSED_STREAM can immediately remove the corresponding stream from the list of open streams.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can work out the details and provide a PR for this, but I'd like to discuss the proposal here first. It might make sense to finish the changes regarding the resetting of streams (related issues: #165 and #171), since this will already significantly change the stream state diagram."

For various reasons (e.g. an embedded device in a controlled environment), a client might want to dispense with TCP altogether when it knows that the endpoint will support QUIC.  It might also be useful in testing to be able to directly reference a QUIC endpoint.\r\n\r\nShould we mint new scheme(s) that allows direct reference to a resource served exclusively over HTTP/QUIC?\r\n\r\n(Note, in HTTP/2 the answer was \"no,\" because HTTP/2 could be negotiated using the same TCP connection.

This PR just enumerates the type ranges of each frame type and forgoes the bit level definitions."

That prevents an off-path attacker guessing client source port and interfering with the client establishing connections with a given sever by spoofing version negotiation failure packets as if coming from that sever. That nonce should be returned by the sever in its version negotiation packets. Previously, client's connection id served such a purpose."

    "body": "The TLS draft currently states that the associated data for AEAD encryption is the empty sequence. This is a deviation from legacy QUIC, which uses the public header as associated data and thus authenticates those fields. Packet number authentication is already accomplished due to its inclusion in the IV.\r\n\r\nIn Tokyo, there was considerable interest in a couple of features that require integrity of Public Header fields:\r\n- Greasing the unused bits in the Public flags\r\n- The connection ID may be used for routing.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that firewalls might block unused public flag bits, particularly if any middlebox could potentially alter them without detection to send a signal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest that we restore use of the full publice header as associated data. I see no reason that this would impose excessive costs on the receiver.\r\n\r\nI believe @janaiyengar brought this issue up first, though I fully endorse it."

If that is so, this should be clarified, because otherwise this can be interpreted as a requirement to double-encrypt streams (on QUIC packet layer with QUIC key, and on TLS record layer with TLS traffic keys)."

    "body": "Quoting myself from the mailing list:\r\n\r\nTL;DR. Encrypt the packet number with ECB or something like it. This\r\nis probably a bad idea but I wanted to write it down.\r\n\r\nI had an idea last night about encrypting the packet number. Here's\r\na diagram of a QUIC regular packet:\r\n\r\n ```  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |   Flags (8)   |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +                     [Connection ID (64)]                      +\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                        [Version (32)]                         |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \r\n   |                  Packet Number (8/16/32/48)                 ...\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                    {Encrypted Payload (*)}                  ...\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   ```\r\nThe insight here is that the reason that the packet number is outside\r\nof the encryption is because it is used as the nonce for the AEAD\r\nfunction. However, there are encryption algorithms (which we usually\r\navoid for various reasons) which do not need a nonce. Specifically,\r\nwhat we could do is derive two keys:\r\n\r\n  K_h: header encryption\r\n  K_p: packet encryption\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you get:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |   Flags (8)   |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +                     [Connection ID (64)]                      +\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                        [Version (32)]                         |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ^ \r\n   |                 {Packet Number (8/16/32/48)}                ... | encrypted with K_h\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ v\r\n   |                    {Encrypted Payload (*)}                  ... ^\r\n   |                                                                 | encrypted with K_p\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ v\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis of course leaves the question of which crypto mode you use to encrypt\r\nthe packet number. The natural choice is ECB, but that only works with\r\ndata values the same size as the cipher block, which for AES is much\r\nbigger than the packet number (128 bits). So, that's waste, though you\r\nmight of course add stuff to the block if we had other headers.\r\nWe could use 3DES (which has a 64-bit block) or FFX (which can be used\r\nwith any block size, but at some additional computational cost).\r\n\r\nTwo pre-emptive responses to common questions:\r\n\r\n1. Yes, ECB and FFX are not generally as good as AEAD algorithms, in\r\nparticular because they don't have integrity and they reveal patterns\r\nin the plaintext. However, this is data which would (a) otherwise be in the\r\nclear and (b) is folded into the ordinary AEAD integrity check.\r\n\r\n2. As long as we correctly generate K_h and K_p independently using\r\na KDF, then any weaknesses in K_h don't implicate K_p.\r\n\r\nAgain, this probably isn't worth doing with the current amount of\r\nstuff in the headers, but I wanted to write it down so that people would\r\nknow about it.\r\n"

    "body": "QUIC doesn't make order guarantees between streams.  The options on the table currently are:\r\n\r\n- Current (-01) draft puts a sequence number in the frames; HPACK data MUST be handled in order, and will HOL-block.  HPACK is exactly the same as HTTP/2.\r\n- Buck's proposal (draft forthcoming) puts two sequence numbers in the frames and modifies the HPACK encoder to prevent blocking references.  Partially-received HPACK frames must block until fully received.  The new encoder could also be used in HTTP/2, but would require changes to existing code.\r\n- [QPACK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bishop-quic-http-and-qpack) modifies HPACK to be order-resilient and permit partial frames to be processed, but breaks from the HPACK encoding enough that you'd have at least some separate code paths.\r\n\r\nAlso agreed to put a \"hard-hat warning\" in this section of the HTTP draft, to warn readers this is still work-in-progress."

If we don't, then 0-RTT data will be unacknowledged until\r\n  the handshake completes.  This isn't a problem if the handshake completes\r\n  without loss, but it could mean that 0-RTT stalls when a handshake packet\r\n  disappears for any reason.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume what you're talking about here is the case where the server's first flight of packets are lost, because the server can only find itself in one of two positions because the CH must fit in a single packet.\r\n\r\n- It has no ClientHello, in which case it must buffer any packets\r\n- It has a ClientHello, in which case it can can complete the handshake by sending its first flight.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that having stalling of 0-RTT in the case where parts of the server's first flight are lost is not that big a deal. If you really don't want stalling, you should retransmit faster :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Open stream 5\r\n3. Close stream 5\r\n4. Open stream 7\r\n\r\nThe network reorders packets 3 and 4. From the server's perspective, the client has violated the maximum.  In order to deal with this, the server will presumably need something more complicated than just \"if violated, kill\" -- maybe kill the connection if it *remains* violated for more than 1-2 RTT?"

On the TLS layer ALPN handshake, client advertises its versions and server picks one.  This is not guaranteed to produce the same version in absence of MITMs, since client and server might have different version preferences.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we change the TLS layer negotiation into \"QUIC client says its version, and server says its supported versions\", similar to #97 .  That way, we effectively repeat the version negotiation information used on transport layer in the handshake, allowing the peers to compare the authenticated information from the handshake with the one they used in transport, and tear down the connection in case those do not match."

Since packets may show up at any load balancer node (both for global and local load balancers), it is very difficult (if not prohibitive) for these load balancers to keep track of the load balancing decision for each active connection and share that state among all nodes.\r\n\r\nTo enable stateless load balancing, load balancers need every packet to include routing information for its connection. Server Proposed Connection ID (#119) with Stateless Rejects (#60) are the methods of choice, as they allow the \"origin server system\" to encode some information into the ConnectionID -- a part of the public header present in every packet.  However, depending on the complexity of the encoded routing information, 64 bits may not be enough to ensure a sufficient amount of entropy in the ConnectionID.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to allow Server Proposed Connection ID to include additional information to be present in every packet. That additional information can take a form of an optional longer Connection ID (and therefore be immutable) or be a new mutable part of the public header."

    "body": "There are currently two problems with streams not contributing to connection-level flow control:\r\n\r\n1. There is no way to negotiate which streams don't contribute (and their number is not limited one would have to negotiate an equation). For HTTP the non-contributing stream numbers are defined in the HTTP/QUIC draft, but defining those streams statically might not be suitable for every protocol.\r\n2. Non-contributing create a DoS opportunity. Current implementations of the QUIC protocol use a MCSP of 100. That means that a client can consume at least 100 * initial flow control window of memory on the server (and possibly even more since there's no size limit of a GET request). That results to an additional memory consumption of more than 6 MB (for comparison: Chrome and quic-go set the connection-level flow control window to 1.5 MB).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nNon-contributing are needed in the following situation: A client that is uploading data will be connection-level flow control blocked if it is sending data faster than the server is consuming it. In that situation, it makes sense to stop the client from overloading the server with more data, but at the same time allowing it to issue new requests.\r\n\r\nThe problem could be solved by defining two connection-level flow control windows: One that defines the amount of data that can be sent, and one that is defines the amount of request data and other application-layer control functions. I will refer two the two windows as \"data fc window\" and \"control fc window\".\r\n\r\nThe rules are:\r\n\r\n- When a peer opens a new stream, it defines which of the two windows the stream should be counted to (This could be done by the setting a bit in the STREAM frame public flag, but we'd have to steal it from some other field. Maybe there's a better solution?). The association of a STREAM to one of the two window cannot be changed later. Every stream has to contribute to either of the two windows.\r\n- A receiver maintains the two connection-level flow control windows and sends connection-level WINDOW_UPDATEs appropriately (there needs to be a way to distinguish between a WINDOW_UPDATE for the data and for the control window of course. Maybe use a bit of the frame type?). \r\n- In HTTP all data MUST be sent in the data fc window, and all request, PRIORITY and SETTINGs frames MUST be sent in the control fc window.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Is this general enough for all protocols? Can the messages in every protocol be mapped into the two categories \"data message\" and \"control message\"?\r\n"

    "body": "One of the major features of QUIC vs TCP is the option of seamless connection migration. One can conceive of a situation where a network middle-man (e.g. an ISP, firewall implementer, etc) might have an interest in blocking this feature, e.g. by detecting connection migrations to their network and dropping those packets. I propose that we think of a way to make a connection migration indistinguishable from a \"normal\" new connection.\r\n\r\nOne solution I can think of would be to have the client send a \"fake\" initial packet with 0-RTT encryption (which would then be discarded by the server as undecryptable). The first few packets sent on the new address would also need to have the version bit set – which the server would have to ignore.\r\n\r\nThis would also require initial packet number randomization (see #35).\r\n\r\nThis issue might conflict somewhat with #185.\r\n\r\nThanks to @lcolitti for pointing this issue out."

    "body": "I know that this might be a hard decision to make, but we don't have many settings and it seems like we might be able to avoid changing them mid-connection.\r\n\r\nGetting settings synchronization right is a pain and we really only have one that is ever likely to change and that's the header table size.  We don't allow initial flow control windows to change (no mechanism exists to allow it), so I question whether that needs changing.  If it does need to change, that would be for the same reason that the flow control window needs to change, which suggests we would need to devise a way to change those too.\r\n\r\nSETTINGS_ACK is a huge amount of machinery.  With 0-RTT, it will mean that just opening a connection will trigger a flurry of SETTINGS_ACK frames from the client just to respond to the server's connection preface (assuming that we're still keeping that, it's not clear).  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we reserved a space for application-specific traffic parameters (see #122), we could put the application-layer settings like header table size in the handshake.  That has some downsides (client values would be unencrypted and you would need to include one set of parameters per application protocol on offer), but it means that there couldn't ever be any confusion about the value of a given setting once the connection was open.\r\n\r\nThat would be a huge simplification to the HTTP mapping."

    "body": "@martinthomson noticed an issue in the QPACK draft that's equally true with HPACK in -01:\r\n\r\nIf you RST_STREAM a stream with a missing QUIC STREAM frame that contains an HPACK frame (HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE), that missing frame never gets retransmitted.  That, in turn, means that no future HPACK frame can be interpreted, ever, because you're missing part of your history.\r\n\r\nOops.\r\n\r\nMy first inclination is to change the HTTP draft to say that message control streams MUST NOT be reset.  If you don't want the message body, reset the data stream, but you MUST read the message headers.  If, for some reason, you cannot do so, then terminate the connection.\r\n\r\nAnyone see a barrier to that (other than the price of ginormous headers)?"

    "body": "QUIC borrows the HTTP/2 state machine, or tries to replicate it as much as it can.  Part of that replication is the idea that a stream is bidirectional.  The state related to outgoing data and the state related to inbound data are tied.\r\n\r\n#174 suggests a simplification that could open up a more dramatic simplification: independent state for each direction.  #171 moves in that direction also.\r\n\r\nThe state machine that results from that is dramatically simpler: idle -> open -> closed.  That is, before packets, packets and after packets.\r\n\r\nThe consequence for the HTTP mapping is largely that it needs a different method for correlating request and response.\r\n\r\n## Correlating request and response\r\n\r\nCurrently, request and response are correlated by matching the stream identifier.  However, unidirectional streams would allow for cases where streams are not created symmetrically.  For instance, server push would only require streams from the server.  Similarly, the server would not be obligated to respond to requests in the order in which they were received (if at all, since it could reset request streams).\r\n\r\nThat implies that this would add a requirement for the server to identify which request a given stream is answering.  This is an extension of the requirement in #174, which only required that the server identify a push promise (actually, it's less onerous, because you only have one request per stream).\r\n\r\nI can imagine an arrangement where a stream containing headers identifies the stream containing the request headers from the client.  Then the stream containing the body identifies the stream that contained the headers.\r\n\r\n## Saving stream identifiers\r\n\r\nThis is a minor point, though it could be relevant for very long-lived connections.\r\n\r\nQUIC currently insists on a strictly monotonically increasing stream identifier: stream N is followed by stream N+2 always, no skipping of streams is permitted.  Aside from wasting every other stream identifier, other streams are wasted by the mapping. \r\n\r\nGET requests don't include a body, but nonetheless require that the client send a HEADERS on stream N, then a FIN on stream N+2.  Including a reference to the initiating stream at the start of the body of a message would use some octets, but potentially fewer than would be used otherwise (particularly if the reference was a varlen encoding of the difference in stream numbers, which would rarely be anything other than 1).\r\n\r\nObviously, this is an optimization for the case where there are no bodies, but that is a case where the optimization is particularly valuable.  Making more requests (which more frequently have no bodies) during the early stages of a connection is critical to performance."

    "body": "QUIC borrows the concept of stream reservation from HTTP/2.  However, there is a small difference between those state machines in that a reserved stream becomes open when data is sent on it.  HTTP/2 reserved streams become half-closed in this case (basically, only the server can send on a reserved stream).\r\n\r\nThe reason we have reservation is that we use stream numbers to identify requests at the HTTP mapping.  We reserve the stream number so that we can use its number in the PUSH_PROMISE frame.  That ties the PUSH_PROMISE - which contains a request - to the stream containing the response.  We need to create streams sequentially, so reservation allows us to \"create\" the stream in the right order and still be able to reference it.\r\n\r\nIn practice, however, this is a nuisance.  Reserved streams don't count toward concurrency limits and so they represent an unbounded state exposure.  Reserved streams might be created in order, but they can be used in any order.  Of course, this is a minor annoyance at best because there is always application state, and maybe priority information for these streams.\r\n\r\nI believe that QUIC has the opportunity to address this annoyance and in the process make the state machine simpler.  If QUIC removed the concept of stream reservation and instead required that application protocols create their correlators for use with talking about future streams, that would greatly simplify things.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we could remove the promised stream identifier from PUSH_PROMISE.  Instead, the stream that carries a push promise response could start with a frame that identified the PUSH_PROMISE by stream and number: \"this stream contains the response for promised request number P on stream N\".  Or, we could mint a new PUSH_PROMISE identifier that could be carried at the start of the stream."

(Retains the existing requirement to respond with RST_STREAM with another RST_STREAM if the stream isn't already closed, which eventually leads to the same result.)\r\n- New REQUEST_RST frame allows peer to solicit a RST_STREAM; text states that this reflects an app recv_close, and that received data is being discarded\r\n\r\nThis should solve the scenarios outlined in #165; a server can ask a client to RST_STREAM its own direction after having sent an early response.  Feedback welcome, of course -- please point out anything I've missed."

Typical point of failures are line cards memory errors or overloaded routers located somewhere on the path, either in the ISP domain or outside.\r\n\r\nThe ISP NOC has to localize asap the point of failure. Currently it proceeds by dichotomy (is the point of failure inside ISP domain or outside ?) using passive monitoring of packet lost and congestion. \r\n\r\nFollowing is the description of the parameters in use:\r\n\r\n1. Packet lost downstream (vice versa for upstream): \r\n- Measure of packet lost before the point of measure needs TCP sequence number\r\n- Measure of lost after the point of measure needs TCP ACK + SACK \r\n\r\n1. Congestion: \r\n- Detects that the congestion is located either before or after the point of measure\r\n- Analysis based on TCP ACK+SACK observation\r\n\r\nQUIC packets numbering should be continuous to allow packet loss monitoring. Flows control fields (ACK, SACK) are available in QUIC but encrypted. \r\n\r\nIt should be nice to use the approach of the TCPinc WG (with an integrity check mechanism) to keep visible the fields allowing fast troubleshooting of the network layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I'm writing this issue because there was some discussion about a change I made in #145, that seemed to be controversial. I spent a lot of time thinking about this, and realized that my changes in that PR were insufficient to address the problem. I think there are multiple issues in the stream state machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Two common scenarios\r\n\r\nI will describe two scenarios where RST_STREAMs will be used regularly when using HTTP/QUIC.\r\n\r\n### Rejected PUSH\r\n\r\nThe sender (in this case a HTTP server) uses HTTP/2 Push to push a resource that the receiver isn't interested in. The receiver therefore sends a RST_STREAM with offset 0 (since it didn't send any data on that stream) to stop the sender from pushing the resource.\r\n\r\nWhen the sender receives the RST_STREAM, there are two options:\r\n\r\n- the transfer hasn't completed yet: The sender then stops sending data and sends a RST_STREAM with a byte offset equal to whatever highest data offset it sent. RST_STREAMs are transmitted reliably, so both sides will *eventually* receive the other side's RST_STREAM and make adjustments to their flow controller. There is no problem here.\r\n- the transfer has already completed (i.e. the sender already sent a STREAM frame with the FIN bit): According to the draft, STREAM frames on reset streams are not retransmitted. If the STREAM frame with the FIN gets lost, and the sender will never be able to make the necessary adjustments to its flow controller. (I'm not sure, but maybe this is what #163 is about).\r\n\r\nA fix for this problem is to **always** send a RST_STREAM as a response to a RST_STREAM, even if the stream already transitioned to the *half closed* state by sending a FIN bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### POST to a 404 URI\r\n\r\nThe second example is more involved, since it involves data flowing bidirectionaly (note that for the PUSH case, the receiver never sent any data on the stream):\r\n\r\nThe sender (in this case a HTTP client) performs a POST request to an URI that the receiver is not reading from, e.g. a non-existing site (HTTP status code 404). The receiver will first send the HTTP response header, and then the (non-empty) 404 body. It will send send a RST_STREAM with a offset equivalent to the body length, to stop the sender, to stop it from sending more data.\r\n\r\nOn the sender side, we have the same situation as in the PUSH case, but let's assume we already resolved that issue.\r\n\r\nThere are two more issues here:\r\n\r\n- We must ensure reliable delivery of the response body (the 404 page). Thus, although the stream was reset, STREAM frames need to be retransmitted.\r\n- The receiver can only send the RST_STREAM **after** composing the response body (since the final byte offset has to be included). However, it would make sense to send the RST_STREAM as soon as possible, to stop the unwanted upload.\r\n\r\nThe first issue could be fixed by requiring that the peer that is resetting a stream MUST ensure reliable delivery of stream data it sent, whereas a peer that is receiving the RST_STREAM SHOULD NOT retransmit any stream data.\r\n\r\nThe second issue could be fixed by defining a RST_STREAM frame that doesn't include a byte offset (or introducing an RST error code that indicates that the byte offset is not set). The receiver in the above example would send this RST_STREAM before sending the 404 body. Since stream data is transmitted reliably, the sender would eventually receive a highest byte offset with a STREAM frame carrying the FIN flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Open points for discussion\r\n\r\nDo the three changes capture all possible use cases of resetting streams. Or do we need\r\n* a way to reset a stream such that the peer initiating the reset doesn't ensure the reliable transmission of the data it already sent\r\n* a way to reset a stream such that the peer receiving the RST has to ensure the reliable transmission up to a certain (which?) offset\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "RST_STREAM kills a stream, but what impact does it have on connection flow control?  Or are we required to account for data in STREAM frames even if they are discarded?\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that data on reset streams is not re-sent, therefore peers get a very different view about what data has been sent.  The receiver of RST_STREAM has no way to manage connection-level flow control for the packets that it has sent.  Packets that it sends before receiving the RST_STREAM might be lost and therefore they might or might not have been counted by the other side.\r\n\r\nAt best, this results in an overly pessimistic view of the connection-level flow control window.  Though it could end up freezing the connection if there are lots of RST_STREAM use with concurrent packet loss.\r\n\r\nThe sender of RST_STREAM can signal the offset of the last octet and thereby ensure that their data is accounted for.  (Separately, we need policing for this value: if it indicates that a flow control window was exceeded, we should treat it as such, even if the frames that it mentions were never sent: opened #162.)\r\n\r\nA potential fix: require RST_STREAM in both directions.  A more drastic fix: make streams unidirectional.\r\n\r\nRelated to the issue @marten-seemann originally mentioned in #145."

That opens an attack where the attacker establishes a connection, then starts spoofing source address.  If the server starts to send to that source address without verifying that the client can receive packets, that's potentially a powerful packet amplification attack.\r\n\r\nIt's not sufficient to look for ACKs or other such things, because no client message includes proof that the client has actually received a packet from the server.  A client can just generate ACK and WINDOW_UPDATE frames as necessary, even new requests.  The only risk a client runs is that it overestimates the number of packets that the server has sent and sends too many spurious ACK frames, which the server will then recognize and react to."

The QUIC stack then inserts the common header and other frames before the stream frames, and needs to pad any unused space.

As QUIC continues to expand the number of streams it supports, HTTP/QUIC ends up spending more bits on stream ID overhead (PRIORITY, PUSH_PROMISE, etc.).\r\n\r\nShould we consider having variable-length stream ID fields in these frames?  Or is the complexity reduction worth stating the full stream ID, especially since we no longer have an HTTP-level stream ID on every frame?"

WINDOW_UPDATEs should be sent when the application consumed data sent by the peer, they should not be based on the highest received offset.\r\n2. I specified the error that should be sent if the peer violates the advertised flow control windows.\r\n3. I explicitly allow an optimization both Chrome and quic-go are already doing: WINDOW_UDPATEs are always sent twice. This increases the probability that the peer receives the frame and can continue sending data, even if one of the two packets is lost or delayed.\r\n4. The description of connection-level flow control was incomplete, since not all streams contribute to the connection-level flow control window. Furthermore, the receiver now has to check for connection-level flow control violations."

    "body": "The current design of the header with its multiple variable length and variable presence fields would seem to require inordinate sender and receiver code complexity. Complexity, especially in parsers (i.e., on the receiver side), is a source both of unclarity in specifications and errors in implementation. I note the following specific issues:\r\n\r\n(1) There are thirteen possible header lengths, and therefore data offsets : 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21. Each of the header fields has a variety of possible offsets. This also increases the complexity of hardware offload implementations of QUIC, but is not complex enough to prevent their implementation and deployment.\r\n\r\n(2) There are combinations of flags that seem to be nonsensical and/or contradictory (e.g., the Packet Number Length codepoint adds 1, 2, 4, or 8 to the length if the Public Reset flag is clear, but 0 to the length if the Public Reset flag is set, see ; Public Reset and Version are mutually exclusive.)\r\n\r\n(3) There appears to be no consideration given to reducing confusability with other deployed UDP protocols in the first N bytes of the header -- see #147 \r\n\r\nI would suggest reducing the number of possible header layouts to reduce complexity, based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n(1) The set of variable header lengths will, at most, save a number of bytes per packet that will often be lost in the underflow of suboptimal path MTU discovery.\r\n\r\n(2) Varlen packet numbering makes sense if the packet number always starts from zero, but random initial packet numbers have other advantages; I presume we'll adopt them at some point. Packet numbers only need to be large enough to keep wrap-arounds to be induced by reordering, so 32 bits (as in the TCP sequence number space) is more than sufficient.\r\n\r\n(3) There is value in treating a version number as a magic number to help reduce the chance of misrecognition of non-QUIC packets as initial QUIC packets at an endpoint; for this 32 bits of version are more than enough, and 24 probably suffice. (This will require a redesign of the version number space, which we might want to do in light of #147 anyway).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an initial proposal, I would propose that either both Connection ID and Version be present, or neither, and that packet number be always present and constant length. This reduces the set of necessary flags to three, leaving us with five flags for reserved/future use (four, if we go ahead and allocate multipath) and the following two header layouts:\r\n\r\nFull Header: 16 octets\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|1|R|K|M| zero  |      version/magic (24 bits)                  |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|                                                               |\r\n+-                      Connection ID                          -+\r\n|                                                               |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|                       Packet Number                           |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\n\r\nTruncated Header: 5 octets\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|0|R|K|M| zero  |                       Packet Number       . . .\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n. . . (cont'd)  |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe header invariant then becomes \"If bit 0x80 in octet 0 is 1, then the seven remaining bits of that octet are reserved for use as flags, and octets 1-3 are a 24-bit version number. If bit 0x80 in octet 0 is 0, then no version number is present; use previous version information for this 5-tuple.\" This can be further simplified by dropping the truncated header entirely, though for very short packets the overhead might be worth saving.\r\n"

All easily reflectable packets off these services should be trivially droppable by a QUIC server. Otherwise, there exist a variety of possible DDoS attacks (of which #135 is one case).\r\n\r\nFor 1-RTT first packets, the probablity of creating a valid ClientHello would seem to be negligible, though there might be some value in reducing the processing necessary to recognize and reject reflected garbage, or to allow it to be rejected before delivery to the server process.\r\n\r\nFor 0-RTT first packets, the header layout should be defined such that a version number (or other magic pattern, though the version number space is sparse enough that it can do double duty as a magic pattern) has an offset and bit pattern that does not occur in traffic that can be generated via reflection off common UDP services."

STREAM frame boundaries MUST be preserved when retransmitting them, i.e. a STREAM frame that is being retransmitted MAY be split into further pieces, but MUST NOT be combined with other STREAM frames.\r\n2. STREAM frames MAY be reassembled before retransmitting them, and STREAM frame boundaries need not be preserved.\r\n\r\nOption 1. is what Chrome and quic-go are currently implementing. 2. is what the draft is specifying in the current version ([here](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/blob/master/draft-ietf-quic-transport.md#sending-and-receiving-data)).\r\n\r\nIf we decide for 1., this needs to be reflected in the draft.

    "body": "I added two commits regarding the closing of streams.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the draft already states that a peer that received stream data beyond the final offset (received either in STREAM frame with the FIN flag set or in a RST_STREAM frame) MUST close the connection with a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error. \r\nHowever, due to packet reordering, the packet carrying the final offset might be delayed, such that the peer first receives STREAM frames up to a certain offset, and then receives the final offset, and notices that the final offset is smaller than the offset it received before. In this case, it MUST also terminate the connection with a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error.\r\n\r\nThe second commit is concerned with what happens when a RST_STREAM is received. A common use case is the following: A client sends a POST request to a server and already begins sending data, but the Request URI doesn't accept data (e.g. there's an error 403 or 404). In those cases, the server will send a HTTP response (note that a 404 has a non-empty response body), and immediately after sending the last byte of the 404 response, it will send a RST_STREAM in order to stop the client from sending more data. In this case, QUIC needs to make sure the data sent by the server is delivered to the client (i.e. the server MUST retransmit any lost data, even after receiving the RST_STREAM response from the client), and the client MUST deliver the data received to the application, even if the packets containing the response body are delayed such that they arrive after the RST_STREAM sent by the server."

TLS doesn't really do compression, though it does provided cached-info ([RFC 7924](https://tools.ietf.org/html/7924)).  Is this sufficient or do we need to ask the TLS working group for a compression feature.  I'm assuming that if we did need to ask, we would also be responsible for providing a design.\r\n\r\nNote that TLS 1.3 aims to provide confidentiality for certificates and compression is generally fraught with hazards that compromise confidentiality.

This is an explicit configuration item, even though TCP flow control would naturally limit the amount of data a client can send to a server with 0-RTT.  The reason for this is that servers might have to hold some or all of the 0-RTT data.  That buffering might be part of replay mitigation, for example.  A server that supports 0-RTT can use that limit to ensure that it doesn't have to buffer more than it is willing to buffer.\r\n\r\nIn #122, I have chosen to carry over the values for initial flow control window and concurrent stream limit.  We might want to provide separate transport parameters for 0-RTT so that servers can apply lower limits."

    "body": "When talking about priority in #104, the question arose.  Say you have two streams and a STREAM frame to send on each, but only enough capacity to send one (due to flow control, congestion, or whatever).  Prioritization information helps us answer this question.  But what if the message is a retransmission of a packet that was determined to be lost.\r\n\r\nI think that the right answer has to do with tracking how long since a packet was originally given to QUIC to send.  And that we don't necessarily need to concern ourselves with whether it was sent previously or not - that will shake out in time anyway.  If it was sent before, it was obviously high enough priority to be worth sending once already.\r\n\r\nThat said, the value of repairing a gap in a stream is pretty high in terms of the ration of bytes delivered to bytes transmitted, so that might have some say."

This is made easier because it only relates to packets that are exchanged before a connection is setup.  Closes #55.\r\n\r\nI've aligned the version negotiation section with the recent changes to -tls.  That includes the client including a version in all packets prior to the commencement of packet protection.\r\n\r\nI'm laying some groundwork for later changes here.

It assumes that ICMP black holes are not a huge problem in the internet, and that no one is using a UDP socket API that prevents them from stopping various noncompliant behaviors. I much prefer this version, although some may find it too restrictive."

    "body": "The way HTTP/2 Priority is generally implemented is to keep a minimal amount in the TLS pipeline / TCP send buffer, retaining as much flexibility as possible to insert frames from high-priority streams ahead of those from lower-priority streams if they become available before the low-priority frames have been \"committed\".  Once data has been encrypted or sent to TCP, it must be sent even if higher-priority data has become available.\r\n\r\nIf the QUIC transport layer has no notion of priority, HTTP may have to do the same on each stream.  It might be preferable to provide the data for each stream into the transport as it becomes available, since the transport is already performing the framing functionality, but that would require the transport to take priority into account when deciding which stream's data to put on the wire next.\r\n\r\nThis need not be a wire format change (HTTP can continue to communicate priority at its layer), but should perhaps be noted as a useful property of an implementation and part of the defined interface with the application layer."

A few related changes along the way that are hopefully uncontroversial:\r\n\r\n- Added a notation conventions section, à la RFC 5201, describing the things we're adding to RFC 2360 (including the ones borrowed from 5201).\r\n- Shifted to using the term \"payload\" rather than \"headers\" and \"body,\" since those are never actually used in the descriptions of subsequent packets or frames.  (Describing frame payloads rather than repeating the Type each time simplifies the diagrams and makes them align more nicely.)\r\n- Totally removed the Diversification Nonce field, since that's optional and dependent on a removed bit (in [32e9d5](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/commit/abf5b35a047f33e75f5d31a2b65c26699532e9d5))\r\n- Removed most of the text and the diagram from the Public Reset, since that depends on specs not in evidence (QUIC-Crypto) and I didn't want to do a diagram of an obsolete packet format.  We'll augment EKR's PR with a diagram later.\r\n- Converted the figure-of-a-table of frame types to an actual table, with references to each section."

    "body": "Proposal on how to define the TLS extension for QUIC, and thereby fix up some of the version negotiation issues (#89, #97).\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n\r\n- TLS doc *does* define the QUIC extension, but it simply contains an opaque blob transported for whichever QUIC version is being used.\r\n- Parameters encoding is specified, and is more \"TLS-y\" than the current protocol -- an enum of possible parameters, carried as numbers rather than strings where appropriate, etc.  Plenty of room to add additional parameters, but unrecognized parameters here will be fatal unless we add an explicit length.\r\n- Server's version list is always required in TLS extension, even if no Version Negotiation packet was sent.  Client MAY open a new connection immediately if it discovers the server would have supported a newer version, and SHOULD use the newer version next time.\r\n- Server SHOULD pick an application protocol supported by the client's proposed version; Version Negotiation only if no overlap on the current version."

However, if the server does Version Negotiation, the client's ClientHello gets thrown away, and the client has to resend the ClientHello anyway.\r\n\r\nI'd be more inclined to say that servers select application protocols compatible with the current version if it can.  There are then two possibilities:\r\n\r\n  - Client learns that server supports a newer version in the response.  Then the client can try again (in parallel or in the future) over the newer version.  Same RTTs to reach the new version/protocol, but able to exchange some data on the initial connection 1 RTT sooner.\r\n  - Server supports no protocol compatible with the client's supported version, and triggers Version Negotiation anyway.  Same RTTs to reach the new version/protocol."

    "body": "#87 covers improving the current use of ALPN and the Alt-Svc v= parameter for HTTP.  However, I think this is something that QUIC needs to solve generically, so forking off a separate issue for that.\r\n\r\nHere are the paths I see that we need to support:\r\n\r\n- **Client to server, first time:** This is inherently a 1-RTT handshake *if* the client guesses the version correctly; 2 RTTs if it's wrong.  This incents clients to attempt the most widely-deployed version of QUIC rather than their highest version.  Consequently, there needs to be a way for a conservative client to discover that a server supports a more advanced version.\r\n- **Client to server, subsequent:** The cached information should contain information about the server's supported versions so the client can come back with the same version as last time. The scenarios where one side has changed need consideration, though:\r\n    - **Client upgraded:** Would require client to cache server's full set of supported versions and compare against the client's supported set at connect time, not just caching the selected version.\r\n    - **Server upgraded:** The current mechanism offers no way for a client to discover that the server would have accepted a version it didn't initially offer, whether because the server didn't previously support it or the client is being conservative.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to see these solved for QUIC independent of Alt-Svc -- there will be other users besides HTTP.\r\n\r\nI think this could be solved by requiring the server to always send its Version Negotiation list in the crypto handshake, not just if a Version Negotiation packet was actually sent.  Clients can discover when the server supports a newer version than they attempted, and either know what to offer next time or actively open a new connection with the new version in parallel."

A specification is required for each supported protocol.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the current draft, all but one \"Both\" frames are *different* between HTTP/2 and HTTP/QUIC.  Small or large, nearly every frame has required some modification to work over QUIC.  If we accept #80 , *all* frames will be different between HTTP/2 and HTTP/QUIC.\r\n\r\nAt that point, is there really a point in continuing to define HTTP/QUIC in relation to HTTP/2, or should we just admit that it's a new, separate thing that's heavily inspired by HTTP/2?  Separate registry, etc., and future extensions can register themselves with both if appropriate?  Or do we keep the same registry anyway to enforce that you'll never wind up with totally unrelated frames sharing the same value across the two protocols?"

    "body": "[EXTENDED_SETTINGS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bishop-httpbis-extended-settings-01) was proposed in the HTTP WG as an extension providing an alternative to the HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame.  While feedback was that it was \"the design we should have had for HTTP/2... more general, saves space in most cases, and includes a flag to request acknowledgment\", there was also a feeling that as an extension it was overkill since most things that needed settings already used SETTINGS.  The advice was to hold it for HTTP/QUIC and make it the default SETTINGS frame there.  So here it is.\r\n\r\nNote that while it uses a slightly different ACK mechanism than HTTP/2 SETTINGS, it's subject to the same timing issues as HTTP/2 SETTINGS ACK over QUIC, namely that you can't know when the setting change has been applied on each stream.  This pull request doesn't fix that; it's tracked by #75 still."

The current HTTP/QUIC draft allows a frame to be 64KB long before decoding the HPACK.  Is this large enough?  That was the boundary we'd said it would take in HTTP/2 to require a single frame.\r\n\r\nIf not, the current draft uses the END_HEADERS bit to indicate that another HEADERS frame will follow, which is effectively the same as CONTINUATION.  The same is not currently defined for PUSH_PROMISE (which really ought to be much smaller).\r\n\r\nIf so, could we drop the END_HEADERS thing entirely and say that HPACK-bearing frames are fully self-contained?

That's really there for HPACK, I presume.\r\n\r\nWe could do likewise for handshake errors, since that's also pluggable -- QUIC will have its own AEAD error codes, but things that could go wrong in the handshake will vary by which handshake protocol we're using."

All stream management is delegated to QUIC.\r\n- HTTP exchanges take up two streams per request/response -- one for data, one for everything else (but mostly headers).  This permits retaining the current behavior (also from HTTP/2) of not flow-controlling non-DATA traffic, and avoids double-framing bodies.\r\n- HPACK frames acquire sequence numbers to enable ordering at the decoder.  This is decidedly suboptimal, but no worse than current and allows us to keep moving and leave the potential redesign of HPACK for the future.\r\n\r\nIt may be more useful to look at the [final content](https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/http-unstraddled/draft-ietf-quic-http.html) rather than the diff -- in places, GitHub isn't finding enough of the retained text to make the diff sensible."

    "body": "Quoting Martin Duke:\r\n> RFC-Compliant ICMP PMTU messages include the\r\n> oversize packet's IP header and the first 8 bytes of the transport. This\r\n> allows  TCP to demultiplex the ICMP to the relevant connection/path, and\r\n> check that the echoed sequence number corresponds to an in-flight segment,\r\n> and that the segment that would have violated the advertised MTU. As TCP\r\n> windows increase, it's true that this may be less effective.\r\n>\r\n> For QUIC, these messages will contain only the UDP header. I believe this is\r\n> sufficient to demux to the right connection (QUIC allows the same 4-tuple\r\n> for multiple connection IDs, but it would be fine to apply it to all such\r\n> connections), but I see no clear mechanism to prevent a blind attacker that\r\n> guesses the 4-tuple from forcing a QUIC connection to revert to the min path\r\n> MTU. Some possibilities:\r\n>     (a) Require routers to send more bytes. This is probably not deployable,\r\n> and in any case because packet numbers always start at zero this doesn't add\r\n> much security.\r\n>     (b) Store UDP or IP data. We could require QUIC to store the UDP\r\n> checksum or IP ID in its send queue, thus allowing it to associate the\r\n> returned headers with a packet in its queue. This is ugly from a layering\r\n> perspective and may not be plausible with hardware offload of checksums,\r\n> various middleboxes, etc.\r\n>     (c) Isolated DF packets. QUIC could pick a long time interval (10\r\n> seconds?) in which is sets DF on a single MTU-sized packet (which may have\r\n> to be padded). QUIC would only accept ICMP messages within an RTT or so of\r\n> having sent one of these MTU probe packets, or until it's acked. Thus the\r\n> probabability an off-path attacker could time it correctly is (RTT / 10\r\n> sec). If there's an extended burst of ICMP to overcome this, that's probably\r\n> an attack indication to handle either in IP, the firewall, or at worst in\r\n> QUIC.  I have some language to codify this, and if we agree this is the\r\n> right approach I can share it."

This means that anything that depends on the number of \"in flight\" packets can't assume that packets before the Last Unacked packet aren't still considered as in transit by the receiver of the STOP_WAITING.  This is particularly relevant for determining how many bits to allocate to packet numbers.\r\n\r\nWe might just provide advice here, but I've marked this as design so that we can discuss it."

[Section 3.1 of RFC2360](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2360#section-3.1) describes the basic idea, but other more recent RFCs have adopted some extensions (e.g., the [HIP protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5201)).\r\n\r\nThe QUIC drafts should use the same representation. The current figures don't always have proportional field lengths, don't show bit flags, etc., which IMO is confusing. If we don't want fo fix the figures, I'd rather replace the current figures with a textual list of fields, rather than using something that looks familiar to IETFers but is really something different.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out http://asciiflow.com/ for making diagrams."

Currently all the mechanisms for telling the client to retry with different options are at the TLS layer, which is too late.\r\n\r\nHow is this negotiated?  Is it baked into the QUIC version?  Is it specified as part of the application mapping (e.g. the HTTP mapping currently requires the TLS 1.3 handshake to be used) and therefore either supplied as part of the Alt-Svc record or implied by the port?"

    "body": "The submission was complicated by the fact that the documents cross-reference each other, which makes for some difficulty during the build/submission process.  Martin worked around that initially by just changing the references to be by title instead of by I-D name.  For the future, however, should we make the documents acyclic?  That would require clarifying the interfaces between the components we intend to make separable, which I think is a strictly good thing.\r\n\r\nMy initial inclination is that the core spec should reference none of the others, and each of the others should reference only the core spec.  The HTTP mapping doesn’t care what loss detection or security handshake is used, only that they provide the features needed by QUIC.  Currently, we explicitly require that the TLS handshake be used, but I’m not convinced that’s necessary.  (Alternately, we could reference the actual TLS RFC and require that “a handshake using TLS” be employed, rather than the particular handshake we’re currently defining.)  The loss detection and security components shouldn’t care about each other either, so long as they can trust that the jobs are getting done.  The core spec should contain the interfaces for all these intersection points.\r\n\r\nGiven that we’ve already agreed that we intend these pieces to be modular, I think this is *probably* an editorial-class change, albeit a big one."

The tricky part is on the server, where it has to work out whether it can use a 1-RTT protected packet, even though it hasn't seen the client's Finished.\r\n\r\nObviously, if there is client authentication, wait.  That's easy.\r\n\r\nI've allowed a server to use these packets if it accepted 0-RTT on the basis that the 1-RTT keys are strictly better than the 0-RTT keys and that it wants to continue processing data.  I've said that it has to assume 0-RTT protection, even though technically these aren't subject to replay.\r\n\r\nI've weaselled out of saying anything about the third case (no 0-RTT).\r\n\r\n@ekr, thoughts?"

That's tricky, because loss or delay of the server's first flight also delays the server's ACKs of 0-RTT data (the server can't use 0-RTT keys)."

This is unlikely, but still something implementations need to handle.  It's not a problem as such unless you insist that connections blow up on decryption failure (which we shouldn't, that's a DoS vector).\r\n\r\nIt's also not a really bad problem because we have packet numbers that should identify the reordered packet as belonging to the older epoch.  We know what the keys were at that time (if we chose to retain them), so it's not even the case that we need to discard the packet every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

QUIC uses a TLS exporter to obtain its initial seed keys.  As long as the exporter secret remains viable (and it will by default in most TLS stacks), then it will be able to compromise any QUIC packet protection keys.\r\n\r\nWe can't close the TLS connection on stream 1 early because it is desirable to have new session tickets issued to clients over time, especially if a server wants to update keys in response to mobility or other significant events.\r\n\r\nWe could recommend that TLS stacks provide an API for destroying an exporter secret, but that would interact poorly with things like token binding which use the exporter secret constantly."

I raised this issue on the QUIC Protocol discussion group (https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/proto-quic/dSSNpQj3shI) but also raising here to signal when the the I-D gets updated.\r\n"
